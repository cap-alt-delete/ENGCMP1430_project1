         <h1>Introduce Yourself</h1>
  <h2>I'm a Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major (former Nursing major, so that was a real 180 degree turn), and I have a certificate in Disability Studies as well. As a disabled designer, I'm really interested not just in the ways that design can accomodate disability, but also in what design has to learn from the disability community (in terms of adaptive practices and questioning of the ideas around mind/body norms). My biggest project at the moment is my independent study, where I'm part of a six person team that produces the podcast <a href='https://open.spotify.com/show/2fiqvtqdyyZfpGATtPLpgl?si=0793906c99c945eb'>Welcomed by Design</a> (which is about, you guessed it, accessible and inclusive design).</h2>

You can add more images if you wish, or subtract... see what happens â€“ you have to be playful to find the purpose of things.-->

  <h2>I (like a ton of people at Pitt) am from <em>about an hour outside of Philly.</em> Growing up, I was really lucky to be surrounded by books, which meant hyperfixating on topics was fully supported (so I never really grew out of that). The family I've found here at Pitt is wonderfully nerdy/creative and supportive of each other's interests, and I'm constantly learning new things from them.</h2>

         <h1>Why UX Design and Usability Testing? Where do you see yourself within this nexus of UX design and product development? </h1>
  <h2>I want to help make our world a more accessible place and feel the best way to do that is to learn how to build the spaces that make up our world (in more accessible ways). Digital spaces in particular are continuing to innovate and be "Wild Wests," with accessibility standards/awareness lagging behind. Learning how to make all these new/future technologies genuinely accessible means testing with and learning from real users (which is why I want to take this course and work on my Usability Testing skills). I aim to be an advocate in the design space, especially about the fact that designing with disability in mind doesn't have to make a product "ugly," but can actually open designers up to new solutions and aesthetics they hadn't even considered before.</h2>
